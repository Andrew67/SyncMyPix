<p>SyncMyPix is a free, open-source Android application developed and supported by me, a Computer Science student, in whatever spare time I can seem to find. I hope that you have found this application useful, and I hope that developers can benefit from the source code.</p><p>SyncMyPix will always be free and open-source. However,
if you would like to show your appreciation for my efforts through a PayPal donation, you
may do so by entering an amount and clicking the "Donate" button below. Thank you
for downloading and using SyncMyPix.</p>
